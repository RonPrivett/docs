- **Tag search** &mdash; The system supports tag search functionality, making it easy to locate and manage resources associated with specific tags.

- **Tag permissions** &mdash; The tag management includes permission settings to control who can create, edit, or delete shared tags. This ensures security and control over the tagging system.
